## About Section
**Headline:** Ancient wisdom. Modern life.

I practice Hellenistic astrology—the original tradition of Western astrology—using techniques like whole sign houses, zodiacal releasing, and profections. This isn't about predicting your future or telling you who to be. It's about understanding the patterns that shape your life, grounded in 2,000+ years of wisdom.

If you're looking for clarity around relationships, career, or just trying to understand why certain themes keep showing up in your life, astrology can offer a surprisingly helpful perspective. Each reading is shaped around what you're actually going through, not a script.

### Background
- My interest in astrology came from trying to figure out my own behaviours
- For the past 4 years i've been studying every day and for the past 3 years i've been giving paid offerings
- By now I had Over 50 paid readings and aprox 100 unpaid readings (when i was learning) with people from all walks of life
- Studied with respected astrologers like Austin Coppock, Demetra George, and Chris Brennan

### What We'll Explore
- Your core personality patterns and natural strengths
- What's happening in your life right now and why certain areas feel challenging
- The questions you've been carrying about yourself and your path
- How ancient astrological techniques can shed light on modern problems
